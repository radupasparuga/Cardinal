# Contributing Guidelines

- create an Issue of your feature/bug
- follow the coding style that is already used in the codebase
- make sure the code doesn't have errors/warnings
- clean code, no lazy coding
- use comments when necessary
- commits should start with one of the following:
    * Add: (used when adding a new feature)
    * Fix: (used when fixing a bug)
    * Change: (used when changing code in an already implemented feature)
    * Cleaning: *insert short description of what you are cleaning* 
- always work on a sepparate branch, pull when done
